- 👋 Hi, I’m Kimchi Balderrama
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Web Development, Data Science, Mechatronics and IoT Services
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Industrial Technician Program in a local institute and Full Stack Web in my free time. I make use of FreeCodeCamp's Curriculum and edX's CS50.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects. I'm into Arduino Development at the moment and I want to integrate Web Development (IoT, Data Science and Mechatronics) and make project prototypes.
- 📫 You can reach me out at @haban3ra on Twitter or find me on Discord @habanera#7439. While you're here, please check out my website as well, kimchibalderrama.now.sh
