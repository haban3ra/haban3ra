- 👋 Hi, I’m Kimchi Balderrama
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Web Development, Data Science, Mechatronics and IoT Services
- 🌱 I’m currently in an internship under the Industrial Technician Program offered by a local institute and Full Stack Web (MERN & JAM Stack) in my free time. I make use of FreeCodeCamp's Curriculum and edX's CS50. Taking Angela Yu's Webdev Bootcamp on Udemy atm.
- ✨  I’m looking to collaborate on future projects. I need a mentor who uses MERN stack, can teach me how to be efficient and productive. I love UI-friendly design, so if you're into a bit of graphic stuff, you are welcome! 
- 💞️ I'm into Arduino Development at the moment and I want to integrate Web Development (IoT, Data Science and Mechatronics) and make project prototypes.
- 📫 Find me on Discord @habanera#7439. While you're here, please check out my [blog](https://kimchibalderrama.me/) as well, or [here](https://kimchibalderrama.vercel.app/) powered by Hugo and Vercel
